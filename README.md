# CS4365-AI-Pathfinding
Class: CS4365  
Assignment: Project 2  
Due Date: N/A  
Goal: Create a pathfinding AI to solve a maze  
Note: I don't have the project's documentation, thus I will summarize what I remember about the assignment below.  

* We were tasked to create an pathfinding AI using any pathfinding algorithm of our choice.  
* The AI was to be able to get from the starting cell to any of the goal cells in a 10x10 cell maze.  
* There must be a minimum of 1 goal cell; however there could be many more than that.  
* There must be exactly 1 starting cell.  
* Each cell can be either a starting cell, goal cell, wall cell, or empty cell.  
* The maze is input as a file containing space separated numbers (0 = empty cell, 1 = starting cell, 2 = goal cell, 3 = wall cell).  
* The program will output into a file the movements the AI made to reach the goal cell (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN). Each movement is on a new line.
